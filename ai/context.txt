I am building an elixir phoenix server to host Magic the Gathering drafts.
Players can join, and once the draft hits 8 players, it will start. 

The problem I seem to be having is that the packs are all lumped together.
I'm seeing pack 1/2/3 within the same round on the front end.
I want to ensure that packs are distributed according to the round, and that each player only gets 1 pack per round.
Review my server code and make sure this logic is followed.

Here are detailed rules:

MTG Draft Technical Specification: Core Rules
Draft Structure

3 rounds total
1 booster pack per player per round
Each pack contains a predetermined number of cards (typically 15)

Draft Flow

Round Initialization

Each player receives one booster pack
Pack contents are revealed to the player holding the pack


Pick Sequence

Each player simultaneously selects one card from their current pack
Selected cards go to the player's draft pool
After picking, players pass their packs to adjacent players


Pack Passing Logic

Round 1: Pass to the LEFT (clockwise)
Round 2: Pass to the RIGHT (counterclockwise)
Round 3: Pass to the LEFT (clockwise)


Round Completion

A round ends when all cards from all packs have been drafted
The next round begins with new packs


Draft Completion

Draft ends when all three rounds are complete
Each player's final pool consists of all cards they picked



Technical Implementation Requirements

Track current round number to determine pass direction
Queue remaining packs for each player
Remove selected cards from packs before passing
Handle empty packs (removing them from circulation)
Provide mechanism for AI players to make automated picks
