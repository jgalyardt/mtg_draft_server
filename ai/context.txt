I am building an elixir phoenix server to host Magic the Gathering drafts.
Players can join, and once the draft hits 8 players, it will start.
I'm working on the front-end now. 
I would like you to generate a concise endpoint summary with instructions for use.
This should include:
- Viewing the list of drafts
- Creating and joining a draft
- Reconnecting to a draft
- Adding computer players to a draft
- Picking a card
- Getting the contents of picked cards so far
- Anything else that makes sense for the front-end to know about
