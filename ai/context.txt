I am building an elixir phoenix server to host Magic the Gathering drafts.
Players can join, and once the draft hits 8 players, it will start. 

I need your help with the "draft end" piece of logic.
Right now, once the last pick is made, the front-end starts spitting out:
{error: "Draft session not found"} from /state

I want to double check on the server draft end implementation.
Ultimately what needs to happen is the user receives the final list of cards in their deck, and the client can handle it from there.

Here are detailed rules:
MTG Draft Technical Specification: Core Rules
Draft Structure

3 rounds total
1 booster pack per player per round
Each pack contains a predetermined number of cards (typically 15)

Draft Flow

Round Initialization

Each player receives one booster pack
Pack contents are revealed to the player holding the pack


Pick Sequence

Each player simultaneously selects one card from their current pack
Selected cards go to the player's draft pool
After picking, players pass their packs to adjacent players


Pack Passing Logic

Round 1: Pass to the LEFT (clockwise)
Round 2: Pass to the RIGHT (counterclockwise)
Round 3: Pass to the LEFT (clockwise)


Round Completion

A round ends when all cards from all packs have been drafted
The next round begins with new packs


Draft Completion

Draft ends when all three rounds are complete
Each player's final pool consists of all cards they picked
