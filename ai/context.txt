I am building an elixir mtg_draft_server with Phoenix.
Eventually, this will be connected to a Vue3 front end, but for now I want to focus on the game logic.
Firebase will handle the hosting. Only authenticated users should be able to call any endpoint.

I would like the draft server to always maintain at least one gen server representing a draft. 
Once it hits 8 players, that draft starts and the server will create a new gen server to direct incoming traffic. 
If a player reconnects, they should re-join the same draft.

Here are the project files:
